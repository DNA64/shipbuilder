</p>
<h1>Drawing</h1>
<p>
The Canvas is a 80x80 blocks ingame (actual size 800x800px)
</p>
<p>
To draw a image simply click any where on the white part of the screen and move 
your mouse around, you can check the symmetry boxes to make some very cool patterns.
</p>
<p>
If you want to paint pixel by pixel you can select the "dot mode"
</p>
<p>
You can select a color by using the RGB sliders on the right
</p>
<h1>Boards</h1>
<p>
Boards are the third dimension, you can navigate them by using the arrow keys or
 the "next" and "previous" buttons at the bottom of the page
</p>
<p>
Fill board will fill the current board with the selected color
</p>
<p>
Clear board will clear the current board
</p>
<p>
Clear boards will clear all of the boards
</p>
<p>
Insert board will insert a board inbetween the left and center board
</p>

<h1>Importing an image</h1>
<p>
The size of the image <b>HAS</b> to be less than 80x80px so it will fit on the canvas
</p>
<p>
It should also probably be a PNG, I haven't tested other file formats as throughly
(or at all)
</p>
<p class='warning'>
There is no visible progress bar for importing an image, just be patient, if it 
takes too long there might be some thing else wrong
</p>
<p>
For best visual fidelity you should change your block type to "blastdoor" 
(before importing your image), regular armor blocks tend to have lots of 
separators between blocks that break up the look of the image
</p>

<h1>Exporting</h1>
<p>
Time and size of file will of course vary depending on how many boards and blocks
you have to export.
</p>
<p class='warning'>
There is also currently no progress bar for exporting
</p>
<p>
The x,y,z sliders and for setting the position of the object in the SE world
</p>
<p>
In order to add your exported ship to a save file (BACK THEM UP FIRST) you need 
to find where they are saved (%appdata%\SpaceEngineers\[etc.]) and open up the 
.sbs file of the world you want to add your ship to (seriously you should use a
 empty world and copy-paste to the world you want, this will avoid conflicts with positioning or whatever)
 You'll want to copy-paste the contents of the export file between the last "&lt;/MyObjectBuilder_EntityBase&gt;"
 and the last (there should only be one) "&lt;/SectorObjects&gt;". Save the file and reload the world
 You might have to look around a bit but you should be able to spot it.
